## Product Context

- **Users**: Demo participants, PMs, and designers evaluating speed-dating UX patterns.
- **Problem**: Need a shareable playground to iterate on matchmaking concepts without spinning up multiple repos or complex deployments.
- **Experience goals**:
  - Smooth onboarding that highlights profile personalization (photos, bio, stats).
  - Engaging dashboard with cards, timers, and control panels to simulate live events.
  - Immersive mini-experiences (`/spin`, `/video-date`) showcasing motion and animation polish.
  - Remote accessibility through a Cloudflare Tunnel so reviewers can interact with live previews securely.
- **Success metrics**: Developers can quickly demo flows, tweak UI components, and share the running experience externally with minimal setup friction.
