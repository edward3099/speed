# Thinking Patterns Analysis Preference

## User Requirement

When the user requests thinking patterns analysis, **ALWAYS use ALL 15 thinking pattern tools** systematically, not just a subset.

## The 15 Thinking Pattern Tools

1. **sequential_thinking** - Step-by-step sequential analysis
2. **mental_model** - Conceptual modeling and mental frameworks
3. **debugging_approach** - Systematic debugging methodologies
4. **stochastic_algorithm** - Probabilistic algorithms and Monte Carlo simulations
5. **collaborative_reasoning** - Multi-perspective collaborative problem solving
6. **decision_framework** - Structured decision analysis frameworks
7. **metacognitive_monitoring** - Self-assessment of knowledge and reasoning
8. **scientific_method** - Formal hypothesis testing and experimentation
9. **structured_argumentation** - Dialectical reasoning and argument analysis
10. **visual_reasoning** - Diagram-based thinking and visual problem solving
11. **domain_modeling** - Creating and refining conceptual domain models
12. **problem_decomposition** - Breaking down complex problems into sub-problems
13. **critical_thinking** - Systematic evaluation of arguments and assumptions
14. **recursive_thinking** - Recursive strategies with base and recursive cases
15. **temporal_thinking** - Modeling systems and reasoning across time

## Approach

- Use all 15 tools systematically to provide comprehensive multi-perspective analysis
- Each tool provides unique insights that converge on optimal solutions
- Don't default to just 3-4 tools (sequential_thinking, mental_model, debugging_approach)
- Apply tools dynamically based on the problem context

## Notes

- **visual_reasoning** may have occasional transient parsing errors but works with proper formatting
- All other tools work reliably
- This preference was established during video stream issue analysis (December 2024)
- Comprehensive use of all tools led to optimal solution convergence

## Example Usage

When analyzing a problem:
1. Start with sequential_thinking to break down the flow
2. Use mental_model to understand the conceptual framework
3. Apply debugging_approach for systematic issue identification
4. Use stochastic_algorithm for probabilistic modeling
5. Engage collaborative_reasoning for multiple perspectives
6. Apply decision_framework for structured decision making
7. Use metacognitive_monitoring for self-assessment
8. Apply scientific_method for hypothesis testing
9. Use structured_argumentation for logical reasoning
10. Create visual_reasoning diagrams for visual understanding
11. Build domain_modeling for domain understanding
12. Decompose with problem_decomposition
13. Apply critical_thinking for validation
14. Use recursive_thinking for recursive patterns
15. Model temporally with temporal_thinking

Then synthesize all insights into a comprehensive solution.
