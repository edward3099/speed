## Project Brief

- **Project**: Speed Date web experience
- **Purpose**: Build an interactive, design-forward matchmaking experience that showcases various engagement flows (dashboard, onboarding, spin, video date) within a single Next.js app.
- **Core requirements**:
  - Use the Next.js App Router with TypeScript, Tailwind, and Chakra UI for layout and styling primitives.
  - Provide reusable UI components (cards, timers, controls) that support rapid experimentation.
  - Ensure the project can be demoed remotely via Cloudflare Tunnel.
- **High-level deliverables**:
  - Production-ready Next.js project structure with global styling, layouts, and shared providers.
  - Feature pages for onboarding, dashboard widgets, and interactive spin/video date flows.
  - Cloudflare Tunnel workflow so stakeholders can access the dev server without direct network access.
